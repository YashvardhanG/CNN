<!-- ABOUT -->
## About

**Image Recognition/Classification Software** uses the **CIFAR-10 Dataset** (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, 10 Classes). The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. <br>

The classes present in the Dataset are:
<ul>
  <li>Airplane</li>
  <li>Automobile</li>
  <li>Bird</li>
  <li>Cat</li>
  <li>Deer</li>
  <li>Dog</li>
  <li>Frog</li>
  <li>Horse</li>
  <li>Ship</li>
  <li>Truck</li>
</ul>

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.<br>

**Note:** The dataset is downloaded as soon as you open the main code, but you may also download the CIFAR-10 Dataset Externally. To download the CIFAR-10 Dataset, head on to <a href = 'https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html'>CIFAR-10</a> website.

<!-- WORKING -->
## Working

You may explore the working of a Convolutional Neural Network <a href = 'https://towardsdatascience.com/convolutional-neural-network-17fb77e76c05#:~:text=Fully%20Connected%20Layer%20is%20simply,into%20the%20fully%20connected%20layer.'>Here</a>.
<br><br>
The working of all the projects can broadly be categorised into two steps:
<ol>
  <li><b>Training:</b><br>This is the initialising step, or can be considered as the pre-processing step of a ConvNet. This indeed is the most important steop because this is where the CNN actually learns and understands the purpose of the user-application, and compiles a data model which can be integrated in a main driver code/application. This is the primary step where data is sorted, analysed, processed and arranged. </li><br>
  <li><b>Testing:</b><br>This is the secondary step of a CNN which includes the usage of the created data model in the previous step. In this step, you will create the driver code/application which will provide a user interface to interact with the dataset in order to carry out a specific operation, for which the application is designed for. This in summary, is the 'fancy' of a CNN.</li><br>
</ol>

To know more about the working of different projects, go ahead and explore all the <a href="#projects">Projects</a>.
<br>
**Note:** Each CNN is different, and you may or may not put both of these steps in the same code.
