<!-- ABOUT -->
## About

Cynthia is an Artificial Intelligent Computer Assistant. It can help you with various kinds of things and reduce your effort of opening and executing things.

Cynthia can execute basic functions like commencing a countdown, information about the weather, and even perform an advanced task such as helping you in taking down notes and read them as well. This Assistant works in two modes, <b>Voice</b> and <b>Text</b> based modes. By default, it runs in text mode (command prompt). The modes can easily be switched by just writing or speaking, 'change mode' as your command.

The purpose behind building this Computer Assistant is to reduce the effort that is required in performing very menial tasks. With this, you may open stuff in your browser, laptop, and further control it just by typing in a command or simply saying it out loud. The assistant is yet in its initial stages and hence, the scope of commands and functionalities is limited. You may just fork this project, and recommended and add any sort of functionality which you think might add to the overall performance.

You may head on the the <a href="#working">Working</a> section to view the working process of the program and, go ahead and head on to the <a href="#developments">Development</a> pane to know the current developement goals with this project.

It has been completely developed using Python programming language, and hence, requires some modules. The list of required modules and installation commands have been given in the <a href="#requirements">next</a> section.

<!-- REQUIREMENTS -->
## Requirements

To install all the required Python Modules, Pull the project, Open Command Prompt, and then type the following command:

```
 > pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** Make sure to change the directory to the directory where the project has been stored. 

You may also download all of them individually using the statements below.

List of Pre-Requisite Python Modules:

```
 > pip install PyDictionary
 > pip install psutil
 > pip install plyer
 > pip install PyAudio
 > pip install sounddevice
 > pip install scipy
 > pip install playsound
 > pip install requests
 > pip install weather-forecast
 > pip install gTTS
 > pip install SpeechRecognition
 > pip install translate
```

<!-- WORKING -->
## Working

There a total of 3 programs in this project.
<ol>
  <li><b>Main:</b><br>This is the main driver code and detects wether the mode has been set to the text mode or voice mode. If no mode is prescribed, the automatically   takes it as text based mode.</li><br>
  <li><b>Voice:</b><br>This consists of the voice functionalities and the entire voice based interface.</li><br>
  <li><b>Cynthia:</b><br>Finally, this consists of the text based interface and functionalities.</li><br>
</ol>

Many functionalities of this project depend on **Internet Connectivity** so, make sure that your device has an active internet connection. The Project further doesn't require anything (except the pre-requisite modules mentioned above obv). For ease of distinction and development, the voice and text interfaces have been maintained separately.
<br>
**Note:** Make sure to pull and keep all these codes into a single directory.
<br><br>
As the assistant is used, it further creates more files and functionalities in the same directory along the way. Head on to the <a href="#developements">next</a> section to view the current goals and developments proposed in this project.
